// Problem 2
// Write a program that applies bonus score to given score in the range [1…9] by the following rules:
// •    If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.
// •    If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.
// •    If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.
// •    If the score is 0 or more than 9, the program prints “invalid score”.

Console.Write("Please enter your score: ");
int score = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
int result = score;
