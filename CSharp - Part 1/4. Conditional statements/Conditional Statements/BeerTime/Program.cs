// Problem 10
// A beer time is after 1:00 PM and before 3:00 AM. Write a program that 
// enters a time in format “hh:mm tt” (an hour in range [01...12], a minute in 
// range [00…59] and AM / PM designator) and prints “beer time” or “non-beer time” 
// according to the definition above or “invalid time” if the time cannot be parsed. 
// Note that you may need to learn how to parse dates and times. */\\\
